# Project Title: Phonepe Pulse Visualization
Overview:
The Phonepe Pulse Visualization project aims to extract, transform, and visualize data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository. The solution includes data extraction through scripting, data transformation using Python and Pandas, insertion into a MySQL database, and the creation of an interactive geo visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly.

Approach:
1. **Data Extraction:**

Clone the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/phonepe-pulse.git

2. **Data Transformation:**

Use Python and Pandas to manipulate and pre-process the data, handling missing values and transforming it into a suitable format.
#. **Database Insertion:**

Utilize the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to a MySQL database and insert the transformed data using SQL commands.
4. **Dashboard Creation:**

Develop an interactive and visually appealing dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly. Leverage Plotly's geo map functions for displaying data on a map and integrate multiple dropdown options for users.
5. **Data Retrieval:**

Connect to the MySQL database using "mysql-connector-python" to fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe. Dynamically update the dashboard with the latest data.
6. **Deployment:**

Ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. Test the solution thoroughly and deploy the dashboard publicly.
Results:
The project will deliver a live geo visualization dashboard with at least 10 dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures. Data will be stored in a MySQL database for efficient retrieval, and the dashboard will be dynamically updated to reflect the latest data.

Learning Outcomes:
1. **Data Extraction and Processing:**

Learn how to use Git to clone data from a GitHub repository and pre-process it using Pandas.
2. **Database Management:**

Gain experience with MySQL for efficient data storage and retrieval.
3. **Visualization and Dashboard Creation:**

Learn to create interactive dashboards using Streamlit and Plotly for data visualization.
4. **Geo Visualization:**

Understand how to create and display data on a map using Plotly's geo map functions.
5. **Dynamic Updating:**

Learn how to create a dashboard that dynamically updates based on the latest data in a database.
6. **Project Development and Deployment:**

Develop a comprehensive and user-friendly solution, from data extraction to dashboard deployment, and gain experience in testing and deploying secure solutions.
